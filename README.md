#   Applying Data Structures to Manipulate Cleansed UN Data This is the simple project in which an application that processes an UN dataset, I manipulate it using a variety of different data structures. In addition, I explore how to implement each data structure using industry-standard Java practices, and gain experience manipulating real life data sets.    ======== Overview ========   1) Arrays                    2) ArrayLists      3) LinkedLists  4) Stacks  5) Queues  6) Hashtables  7) Miscellaneous Collections Methods and Application Demo
